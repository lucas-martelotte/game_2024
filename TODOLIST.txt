============ MANDATORY CHANGES ============

- Create a dedicated collision test scene with all the features
- Optimize GJK
- Add documentation to collision module
- Implement minimal translation vector for GJK
- Implement minimal translation vector for AABB
- Implement point collision for Polygon
- Implement __is_convex for polygon
- Implement Circle-Polygon collision
- Implement bounding_rect of ComplexCollider

================== IDEAS ==================

- Implement convex hull (?)
- Dictionary GAME_ENTITY_STATE_2_SPRITE (?)
  - Sprite has data: [set[Collider], list[Surface]]
  - Think about this well because parts of a Sprite may vary
    if, for instance, the player picks up an upgrade
- Change get_surface to get_surfaces() ->  list[tuple[Surface, Pos]]
  since we might need to render bullets and other stuff
